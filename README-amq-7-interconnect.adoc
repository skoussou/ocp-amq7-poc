== STAGE 1:  Install all necessary components (templates, images/streams) and preps

* Install amq-interconnect images

	$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep amq-interconnect-1.2-openshift

	$ oc import-image amq-interconnect-1.2-openshift:latest -n openshift --from=registry.access.redhat.com/amq-interconnect/amq-interconnect-1.2-openshift --confirm


* Insstall templates

	(the templates are now also available also under /amq-7-templates)

	oc login -u system:admin
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/amq-interconnect-1-openshift-image/amq-interconnect-11-dev/templates/amq-interconnect-1-basic.yaml | oc create -f - -n openshift
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/amq-interconnect-1-openshift-image/amq-interconnect-11-dev/templates/amq-interconnect-1-tls-auth.yaml | oc create -f - -n openshift

== STAGE 3:  AMQ Interonnect Setup


=== Prerequisites

To deploy and test this topology, you should have 

* at least one AMQ 7 broker deployed and running on some host. If you have more instances, all of them should work in the same cluster definition.
* Samples will work with a set of queues that you should define in your AMQ 7 brokers. To do that, please add to address section of the  $AMQ_BROKER/etc/broker.xml file the following definitions (or as above via the template)
	
	<address name="demoQueue">
	  <anycast>
	    <queue name="demoQueue" />
	  </anycast>
	</address>


=== Install Interconnect Router-1

	You can inspect the interconnect template installed earlier
	oc describe template amq-interconnect-1-basic -n openshift

* Interconnect exposes the following ports (we will direct traffic to *5672 (AMQP no-auth)* and *8672 (web console)*

	Target Port.
	5672		External clients or message brokers to connect to the router mesh without authentication
	5671 		External clients or message brokers to connect to the router mesh with authentication
	55672		External routers to connect to the router mesh
	8672		Accessing the web console

* Create *router-1*

	oc new-app  --template=amq-interconnect-1-basic -pAPPLICATION_NAME=router-1 -l app=interconnect -n amq-pocs-non-ssl

* Create OCP Route to Interconnect *router-1* - WEB Console OCP Route (8672)

	echo 'apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
	kind: Route
	metadata:
	  labels:
	    application: router-1
	    app: interconnect 
	  name: router-1-web-console
	spec:
	  host: router-1-web-console-amq-pocs-interconnectors.192.168.42.67.nip.io
	  port:
	    targetPort: 8672
	  to:
	    kind: Service
	    name: router-1
	    weight: 100
	  wildcardPolicy: None
	status:
	  loadBalancer: {}' | oc create -f - -n amq-pocs-interconnectors


* Expose Interconnect *router-1* AMQP Port over service  (8672) (*IMPORTANT*: Using NodePort takes place due to inability to go over (8)443 with correct SSL certificates. *It is not recommended practice to use NodePort* instead use OCP Route with correct SSL certificates)

	echo 'apiVersion: v1
	kind: Service
	metadata:
	  labels:
	    application: router-1
	    app: interconnect
	  name: router-1-external-tcp
	spec:
	  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
	  ports:
	   -  nodePort: 30002
	      port: 5672
	      protocol: TCP
	      targetPort: 5672
	  selector:
	    deploymentConfig: router-1
	  sessionAffinity: None
	  type: NodePort' | oc create -f - -n amq-pocs-interconnectors

=== Result - Initial Installation 

The outcome will be 3 routes which can be used to access the content of the *3 brokers* and the interconnect *router-1*

image:pics/amq-interconnect-Routes-interconnect-1-brokers-3-consoles.png["Routes for Consoles",height=240] 

The topology in *router-1* web-console will be showing only the router and its console connected

=== Test Interconnect Scenario 1

*Aim: Showcase transparrent connection to brokers via interconnect for both brokered and direct communications*

* Interconnect via *router-1* is going to be used for direct access to *broker-a* and *broker-b* addresses
** Configure interconnect *router-1* to access  *broker-a* and *broker-b*

	Either via the OCP console access Resources-->Config Maps-->router-1 (click on it, Actions, Edit Yaml) add the following
	or
	oc edit cm router-1


    connector {        
       name: broker-a
       role: route-container
       host: broker-a-amq-headless.amq-pocs-interconnectors.svc   
       port: 61616
       saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS
    }

    connector {
       name: broker-b
       role: route-container
       host: broker-b-amq-headless.amq-pocs-interconnectors.svc   
       port: 61616
       saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS
    }


** Configure interconnect *router-1* to give access to address *demoQueue* on *broker-a* (both in/out ie. write/read)


    linkRoute {
       prefix: demoQueue
       connection: broker-a
       direction: in
    }

    linkRoute {
       prefix: demoQueue
       connection: broker-a
       direction: out
    }


** Configure interconnect *router-1* to give access to address *demoQueue* on *broker-b* (both in/out ie. write/read)

    linkRoute {
       prefix: demoQueue
       connection: broker-b
       direction: in
    }

    linkRoute {
       prefix: demoQueue
       connection: broker-b
       direction: out
    }


** No Configuraton on interconnect *router-1* to give access to address *dq2* 

** Go to OCP console on Applications-->Deployments-->router-1 (Press the *Deploy*) to take effect on the changes


* *Test-1* - Sending messages repeatedly to address *demoQueue* (by executing the following) results in the router "loadbalancing" writes/reads between  *broker-a* and *broker-b* (verify by looking at both on Queue *demoQueue* and the number of messages written/acknowledged/read)

	cd ocp-amq7-poc/clients/jms/apache-qpid-jms-0.37.0.redhat-00001/examples/
	java -DUSER="amq-demo-user" -DPASSWORD="amqDemoPassword" -cp "target/classes/:target/dependency/*" org.apache.qpid.jms.example.HelloWorld

	Ensure ocp-amq7-poc/clients/jms/apache-qpid-jms-0.37.0.redhat-00001/examples/target/classes/jndi.properties|-
			java.naming.factory.initial = org.apache.qpid.jms.jndi.JmsInitialContextFactory
			connectionfactory.myFactoryLookup = amqp://192.168.42.67:30002
			queue.myQueueLookup = demoQueue
			topic.myTopicLookup = demoTopic


* *Test-2* - Sending messages repeatedly to address *dq2* (by executing the following) results in the router correctly routing back a response to the *producer/consumer* HelloWorld program

	cd ocp-amq7-poc/clients/jms/apache-qpid-jms-0.37.0.redhat-00001-dq2/examples/
	java -DUSER="amq-demo-user" -DPASSWORD="amqDemoPassword" -cp "target/classes/:target/dependency/*" org.apache.qpid.jms.example.HelloWorld

	Ensure ocp-amq7-poc/clients/jms/apache-qpid-jms-0.37.0.redhat-00001/examples/target/classes/jndi.properties|-
			java.naming.factory.initial = org.apache.qpid.jms.jndi.JmsInitialContextFactory
			connectionfactory.myFactoryLookup = amqp://192.168.42.67:30002
			queue.myQueueLookup = dq2
			topic.myTopicLookup = demoTopic

	*IMPORTANT*: the way this works is because both the consumer & producer are connected at the time and the *router-1* routes the message directly


* Resulting Topology

	The topology in *router-1* web-console will now be showing the router and its console connected as well as the the 2 AMQ7 Brokers connected

image:pics/amq-interconnect-console-router-1-Topology-B.png["Topology Initial",height=240] 

** Facility *qdstat* shows on the router pod

==== Test Interconnect Scenario 2

*Aim: Showcase no changes to end-clients whilst topology changes behind the interconnect*

* Interconnect via *router-1* is going to be used for direct access to *broker-a* and *broker-b* and *broker-c* addresses
** All configs remain as in Scenario
** Configure interconnect *router-1* to access in addition *broker-c* and *broker-b*

    Either via the OCP console access Resources-->Config Maps-->router-1 (click on it, Actions, Edit Yaml) add the following
    or
    oc edit cm router-1

    connector {        
       name: broker-c
       role: route-container
       host: broker-c-amq-headless.amq-pocs-interconnectors.svc   
       port: 61616
       saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS
    }


** Configure interconnect *router-1* to give access to address *dq2* on *broker-c* (both in/out ie. write/read) - This would showcase no changes to end-clients whilst topology changes behind the interconnect

    linkRoute {

       connection: broker-c
       direction: in
    }

    linkRoute {
       prefix: dq2

** Differences between link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html-single/using_amq_interconnect/#addresses[mobile and link route addresses]

* Interconnect via *router-1* is going to be used for direct access to *broker-a* and *broker-b* and *broker-c* addresses
** All configs to remain as in Scenario
** Configure interconnect *router-1* to give access to address:
*** *demoQueue* on on *broker-a* and *broker-b* via *autoLink* (mobile Address) 

    Either via the OCP console access Resources-->Config Maps-->router-1 (click on it, Actions, Edit Yaml) add the following
    or
    oc edit cm router-1

    address {
      prefix: demoQueue
      waypoint: yes
    }

    autoLink {
       addr: demoQueue
       connection: broker-a
       direction: in
    }

    autoLink {
       addr: demoQueue
       connection: broker-a
       direction: out
    }

    autoLink {
       addr: demoQueue
       connection: broker-b
       direction: in
    }

    autoLink {
       addr: demoQueue
       connection: broker-b
       direction: out
    }


***  *dq2* on *broker-c* (both in/out ie. write/read) 

    address {
      prefix: dq2
      waypoint: yes
    }

    autoLink {
       addr: dq2
       connection: broker-c
       direction: in
    }

    autoLink {
       addr: dq2
       connection: broker-c
       direction: out
    }

** Go to OCP console on Applications-->Deployments-->router-1 (Press the *Deploy*) to take effect on the changes



* *Test-1* - Sending messages repeatedly to address *demoQueue* (by executing the following) results in the router "loadbalancing" writes/reads between  *broker-a* and *broker-b* (verify by looking at both on Queue *demoQueue* and the number of messages written/acknowledged/read)

	cd ocp-amq7-poc/clients/jms/apache-qpid-jms-0.37.0.redhat-00001/examples/

			connectionfactory.myFactoryLookup = amqp://192.168.42.67:30002
			queue.myQueueLookup = demoQueue
			topic.myTopicLookup = demoTopic


* *Test-2* - Sending messages repeatedly to address *dq2* (by executing the following) results in the router correctly routing messages to *broker-c* (verify by looking at both on Queue *dq2* and the number of messages written/acknowledged/read)

	cd ocp-amq7-poc/clients/jms/apache-qpid-jms-0.37.0.redhat-00001-dq2/examples/

=== Connecting clients to a router mesh

Procedure: To connect a client to the router mesh, use the following connection URL syntax:

    <scheme>://[<username>@]<host>[:<port>]

    <scheme>
        For unencrypted TCP, use amqp. If you deployed the router mesh with SSL/TLS authentication, use amqps. 
    <username>
        If you deployed the router mesh with SASL user name/password authentication, you must provide the client’s user name. 
    <host>
        If the client is in the same OpenShift cluster as the router mesh, use the OpenShift service IP address. Otherwise, use the host name of the route. 
    <port>
        If you are connecting to a route, you must specify the port. Use 80 for unsecured connections, and 443 for secured connections. 

    The following table shows some example connection URLs.
    URL	Description

    amqp://192.0.2.1
    	

    The client and router mesh are both in the same OpenShift cluster, so the service IP address is used for the connection URL.

    amqps://amq-interconnect-myproject.192.0.2.1.nip.io:443
    	

    The client is outside of OpenShift, so the route host name is used for the connection URL. In this case, SSL/TLS authentication is implemented, which requires the amqps scheme and port 443.

== Scaling the router mesh


You can scale your deployment to add or remove routers from the router mesh. When you scale up the router mesh, a new pod is deployed with a router, which automatically connects to any other running routers.

Procedure

    Navigate to the Overview page.

    Do one of the following:

        To add routers to the mesh, click the up arrow next to the pods diagram.

        A new pod is deployed, with a router running inside of it. The router automatically connects to each router in the mesh to maintain a full mesh topology.

        To remove routes from the mesh, click the down arrow next to the pods diagram.

        A pod is removed from the deployment, and its router is shut down. Any clients that were connected to the router are disconnected, but can fail over to any of the remaining routers in the mesh. 





== STAGE 4:  AMQ Interonnect Topology Scenarios

This is to showcase some features of the Interconnect

=== Install Router Type: Aggregator Router

This router will manage the incoming and outgoing messages from other routers to the AMQ 7 HA cluster topology behind it.


=== Install Router Type: Producer Router

This router will manage the incoming messages from producers to the aggregator router.


=== Install Router Type: Consumer Router

This router will manage the outgoing messages from the aggregator router to the consumer router.
